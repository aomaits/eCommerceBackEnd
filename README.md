# e-Commerce Back-End
d
## Description
This project was created for an e-Commerce company to be able to track their inventory using a SQL database. The user is able to track their goods by using lists of products, categories, and tags which from which they can add, update, or remove any items or values. 

Future iterations of this product would include a functional front-end to allow the user a simpler interface for their database. 

## Installation
The user will need to have a mySQL login in order to access this application. 

## Usage
The user will need to be able to use a back-end interface to display the results of their queries. In our case, we used Insomnia. 

For example, when making a GET request at the products url, the user can then see all products (along with the associated category and any associated tags).

Users can:
- View all products, tags, or categories.
- View any single product, tag, or category.
- Add a new product, tag, or category.
- Update any product, tag, or category.
- Delete any product, tag, or category.
